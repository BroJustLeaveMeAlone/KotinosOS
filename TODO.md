# KotinosOS — Task Tracker

## How this works

Before starting a milestone, break it into concrete steps in this file. Check
them off as they complete. Steps discovered mid-flight get added rather than
quietly absorbed, so the record shows what the work actually took.

The **vision and the milestone list do not change** — those live in
[`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md). Only the steps inside a milestone change as reality
teaches us things.

## Project setup ✅

- [x] Name chosen: **KotinosOS** (olive wreath of the ancient Olympic Games)
- [x] Logo added (`assets/kotinos-logo.png`) and shown in README
- [x] Repository live at `BroJustLeaveMeAlone/KotinosOS`
- [x] README written (vision, architecture, build steps, roadmap)
- [x] LF line endings enforced (`.gitattributes`) — CRLF would break shebangs and unit files inside the image
- [ ] **Choose a license** — until one exists, nobody may legally use or contribute
- [ ] Logo: transparent-background PNG + SVG (current asset is white-background, shows a white box on dark themes)

## Milestone 1 — Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** a custom Fedora bootc image boots in Hyper-V with Btrfs subvolumes,
and the full `v1 → upgrade → v2 → rollback → v1` cycle works with user data
surviving every transition.

### Planned steps

- [x] **Step 0 — Toolchain.** WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04, podman 5.7.0 rootful, Hyper-V enabled, repo + GitHub remote
- [x] **Step 1 — Risk spike.** Proved Btrfs subvolumes are creatable at build time. Key discovery: only `customizations.disk` supports subvolumes; `customizations.filesystem` silently limits you to `/` and `/boot`. Validated cheaply with the builder's `manifest` subcommand (parses config without building)
- [x] **Step 2 — Repo skeleton.** `Containerfile`, `config.toml`, `build.sh`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`
- [x] **Step 3 — Minimal image.** Pinned `fedora-bootc:44`. Digest comparison showed tag `45` is byte-identical to `rawhide` — picking the highest number would have silently shipped on a development branch
- [x] **Step 4 — Disk image.** `vhd` output, converted to dynamic VHDX (21 GB sparse → 2.1 GB actual)
- [x] **Step 5 — Boot.** Gen2 UEFI VM, Secure Boot off, boots and reaches sshd
- [x] **Step 6 — Prove rollback.** Full cycle verified with a sentinel file (see results below)

### Unplanned steps that emerged

- [x] **Dev access strategy.** Gitignored `config.dev.toml` overlay merged at build time, so no password hash ever lands in git history
- [x] **Credentials persisted** to `.dev-secrets/` (gitignored) — they were only in a session-scoped temp dir
- [x] **Local OCI registry.** `registry:2` in WSL, bridged to the guest via `netsh portproxy` on the NAT gateway. Required because `bootc upgrade` can't resolve a `localhost/` ref inside the VM. *(This is early M7 groundwork.)*
- [x] **Fix: dropped `@home`** after finding it mounted nowhere and its mount unit failing
- [x] **Fix: dev SSH key moved under `/usr`** (`DEV_SSH_KEY` build arg) after `/var`-based keys proved unreachable
- [x] **Fix: `/boot` early-mount drop-in** after discovering rollback silently did nothing

### Result

| Stage | Booted | Digest | Sentinel in `/var` |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 initial | `BUILD_ID=v1` | `c44709f0…` | written |
| after `bootc upgrade` | `BUILD_ID=v2` | `a79e87c5…` | survived |
| after `bootc rollback` | `BUILD_ID=v1` | `c44709f0…` | survived |

`/var` stayed on `subvol=@var` throughout. The two-layer safety net is real:
**the OS rolled back while user data persisted.**

### What this changed for later milestones

1. **There is no `/home`.** `/home` → `/var/home`, `/root` → `/var/roothome`. All user data lives under `/var`, so `@var` is the volume snapper must cover in M2.
2. **A separate `/var` subvolume does not inherit the image's `/var`.** systemd-tmpfiles creates a bare skeleton; image-baked homes and keys are silently discarded. **Users must be provisioned at first boot** — this is a new prerequisite for M2.
3. **`/boot` must mount early or rollback silently fails.** `bootc rollback` reports success, changes nothing, and the next boot returns to the same deployment. Also: ostree does *not* rewrite `/boot/loader/entries` on rollback (it swaps the `/ostree/boot.N` symlinks), so unchanged timestamps are not evidence of failure — check `ostree admin status`.

## Milestone 2 — Safety net ⬜ NOT STARTED

Steps get written here when we begin. Carried forward from M1:

- **Prerequisite:** first-boot user provisioning (see finding #2 above) — decide whether it belongs in M2 or lands as its own small phase first
- snapper must target **`@var`**, not `/home`
- Escalation hook: pin the bootc deployment *and* snapshot `@var` before granting admin mode
- Recovery environment reachable from the bootloader
- Adversarial test: run `rm -rf /*` and document exactly what survives
