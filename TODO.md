# KotinosOS — Task Tracker

## How this works

Before starting a milestone, break it into concrete steps in this file. Check
them off as they complete. Steps discovered mid-flight get added rather than
quietly absorbed, so the record shows what the work actually took.

The **vision and the milestone list do not change** — those live in
[`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md). Only the steps inside a milestone change as reality
teaches us things.

## Project setup ✅

- [x] Name chosen: **KotinosOS** (olive wreath of the ancient Olympic Games)
- [x] Logo added (`assets/kotinos-logo.png`) and shown in README
- [x] Repository live at `BroJustLeaveMeAlone/KotinosOS`
- [x] README written (vision, architecture, build steps, roadmap)

## Milestone 1 — Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** a custom Fedora bootc image boots in Hyper-V with Btrfs subvolumes,
and the full `v1 → upgrade → v2 → rollback → v1` cycle works with user data
surviving every transition.

### Planned steps

- [x] **Step 0 — Toolchain.** WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04, podman 5.7.0 rootful, Hyper-V enabled, repo + GitHub remote
- [x] **Step 1 — Risk spike.** Proved Btrfs subvolumes are creatable at build time. Key discovery: only `customizations.disk` supports subvolumes; `customizations.filesystem` silently limits you to `/` and `/boot`. Validated cheaply with the builder's `manifest` subcommand (parses config without building)
- [x] **Step 2 — Repo skeleton.** `Containerfile`, `config.toml`, `build.sh`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`
- [x] **Step 3 — Minimal image.** Pinned `fedora-bootc:44`. Digest comparison showed tag `45` is byte-identical to `rawhide` — picking the highest number would have silently shipped on a development branch
- [x] **Step 4 — Disk image.** `vhd` output, converted to dynamic VHDX (21 GB sparse → 2.1 GB actual)
- [x] **Step 5 — Boot.** Gen2 UEFI VM, Secure Boot off, boots and reaches sshd
- [x] **Step 6 — Prove rollback.** Full cycle verified with a sentinel file (see results below)

### Unplanned steps that emerged

- [x] **Dev access strategy.** Gitignored `config.dev.toml` overlay merged at build time, so no password hash ever lands in git history
- [x] **Credentials persisted** to `.dev-secrets/` (gitignored) — they were only in a session-scoped temp dir
- [x] **Local OCI registry.** `registry:2` in WSL, bridged to the guest via `netsh portproxy` on the NAT gateway. Required because `bootc upgrade` can't resolve a `localhost/` ref inside the VM. *(This is early M7 groundwork.)*
- [x] **Fix: dropped `@home`** after finding it mounted nowhere and its mount unit failing
- [x] **Fix: dev SSH key moved under `/usr`** (`DEV_SSH_KEY` build arg) after `/var`-based keys proved unreachable
- [x] **Fix: `/boot` early-mount drop-in** after discovering rollback silently did nothing

### Result

| Stage | Booted | Digest | Sentinel in `/var` |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 initial | `BUILD_ID=v1` | `c44709f0…` | written |
| after `bootc upgrade` | `BUILD_ID=v2` | `a79e87c5…` | survived |
| after `bootc rollback` | `BUILD_ID=v1` | `c44709f0…` | survived |

`/var` stayed on `subvol=@var` throughout. The two-layer safety net is real:
**the OS rolled back while user data persisted.**

### What this changed for later milestones

1. **There is no `/home`.** `/home` → `/var/home`, `/root` → `/var/roothome`. All user data lives under `/var`, so `@var` is the volume snapper must cover in M2.
2. **A separate `/var` subvolume does not inherit the image's `/var`.** systemd-tmpfiles creates a bare skeleton; image-baked homes and keys are silently discarded. **Users must be provisioned at first boot** — this is a new prerequisite for M2.
3. **`/boot` must mount early or rollback silently fails.** `bootc rollback` reports success, changes nothing, and the next boot returns to the same deployment. Also: ostree does *not* rewrite `/boot/loader/entries` on rollback (it swaps the `/ostree/boot.N` symlinks), so unchanged timestamps are not evidence of failure — check `ostree admin status`.

## Milestone 1.5 — First-boot provisioning ✅ COMPLETE

**In plain words:** make the machine create your user account the first time it
boots.

**Why this exists.** M1 finding #2: when `/var` is its own subvolume, bootc does
not copy the image's `/var` into it — systemd-tmpfiles lays down a bare
skeleton instead. Every account's home lives under `/var` (`/home` →
`/var/home`, `/root` → `/var/roothome`), so **any user baked into the image is
silently discarded at first boot.** This locked us out of our own VM twice.
Provisioning therefore has to happen on the running machine, not at build time.

**Why it blocks M2.** Snapper, the escalation hook, and admin mode all assume a
real user account exists and that its data lives somewhere snapshottable.
Building those on a system that can't reliably create a user means testing the
safety net against nothing.

**Exit criteria:** boot a fresh image and land with a working account whose home
is on `@var`, created at first boot, that survives an upgrade and a rollback.

### Steps

- [x] **Mechanism chosen: systemd oneshot unit.** Preferred over cloud-init (heavy, cloud-oriented) and `systemd-firstboot` (handles locale/hostname, not real user accounts). Gated by a stamp file in `/var` rather than `ConditionFirstBoot`, because the stamp lives on the same volume as the thing it guards — if `/var` is ever reset, provisioning correctly runs again
- [x] Provisioning unit + script shipped under `/usr` (`files/kotinos-firstboot.{sh,service}`), image-managed so it cannot be shadowed
- [x] Account created at first boot: user, `wheel`, home at `/var/home/<user>`, shell
- [x] SSH keys installed into the real runtime home as the primary path; `/usr` debug path kept as recovery
- [x] Idempotent — `RequiresMountsFor=/var`, stamp at `/var/lib/kotinos/.provisioned`, never clobbers an existing home
- [x] SELinux contexts correct — `restorecon` yields `ssh_home_t` on `.ssh` and `authorized_keys`
- [x] Verified on a clean VM: account exists, home populated, key login works
- [x] Verified across `bootc upgrade` **and** `bootc rollback`
- [ ] *(deferred to M3)* How the real product asks for username/password — belongs with the first-run experience

### Result

| Stage | `BUILD_ID` | Account | User data | Provisioning re-ran? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| first boot | v3 | created (uid 1001, `wheel`) | — | ran once |
| after reboot | v3 | intact | intact | no (`ConditionResult=no`) |
| after `bootc upgrade` | v4 | intact | intact | no |
| after `bootc rollback` | v3 | intact | intact | no |

Login as the provisioned user via SSH key confirmed working after rollback.

**Design notes.** The password is *locked*, not empty — an empty password would
permit passwordless console login; locked denies password auth entirely until
M3 collects a real one. The dev key is installed in two places on purpose: the
normal path (copied into the user's home at first boot) and a recovery path read
straight from `/usr` by sshd, so a bug in provisioning is debuggable instead of
locking us out of the machine — which happened twice during M1.

## Milestone 2 — Safety net 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**In plain words:** the OS can already undo a bad *update*. This milestone lets
it undo a bad *day* — accidental deletion, a botched config, a destructive
command. You notice it exactly once: when something goes wrong and the machine
offers to put it back.

**Exit criteria:** scheduled snapshots of user data exist with a bounded disk
budget; a snapshot is taken automatically before admin escalation; a broken
system can be recovered from the bootloader; and `rm -rf /*` has been run with
the survival story written down.

**The hard part** is restoring, not snapshotting. bootc owns `/`, so rolling
back user data on `@var` is a *different* mechanism from OS rollback — and it
has to work when the machine is too broken to boot normally.

### Steps

- [ ] Install `snapper` in the image; decide config placement (`/etc` is 3-way merged, so shipped configs survive upgrades)
- [ ] Register a snapper config against **`@var`** at first boot — `.snapshots` cannot be created at build time, same `/var` reason as M1.5
- [ ] Set retention + disk budget (timeline counts, `SPACE_LIMIT`, `FREE_LIMIT`) so snapshots can never fill the disk
- [ ] Enable timeline + cleanup timers; verify snapshots actually appear on schedule
- [ ] **Escalation hook:** one command that pins the current bootc deployment *and* snapshots `@var`, to be wired to M5's 2FA gate
- [ ] Decide and implement the `/var` restore mechanism (file-level restore vs. subvolume swap) — the genuinely open design question
- [ ] Recovery environment reachable from the bootloader when normal boot fails
- [ ] Verify recovery against a deliberately corrupted system
- [ ] **Adversarial test:** run `rm -rf /*` in a VM and document exactly what survives and what is lost
